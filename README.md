# Glass
Glass is primarily an early-stage programming language made using C++ from scratch. The syntax of Glass is highly inspired by C# and Python. Glass is going to be a powerful, fast and easy to learn programming language. Currently not much is implemented, however the progress for Glass is on a pretty good track.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, Glass is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Glass`.

## The Plan
The plan for Glass is two-fold: to create a Powerful OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. In future Glass can also be used to develop GUI applications and Games using OpenGL (It's not confirmed that OpenGL will be used in Glass for Graphics rendering, We may use something else).

## Main Features to Come
- Loops (For loops, While loops)
- Conditional statements (If else statements, Switch statements)
- Functions
- Classes
- Graphics rendering
- GUI application developement support
- Custom Library building support (By this feature you can make a Glass Library using ".glass" files only, this means you don't need to access the source code everytime you want to create a new Library for Glass)

And much more...

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.<br />
- Mingw-w64
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### How To Use
- To compile Glass, open Command Prompt in Glass Directory and type `scripts\Build.bat`.
- Then in "bin" folder, open Command Prompt and type `Glass "full path of your file"`.
- If you haven't created your own file then type `Glass "full path of any of the sample projects"` from `res\sample projects` folder.
- If you want to create your own Glass program then create a new file with an extention of `.glass` at the very end of it.

## Short Term Goals
By the end of 2021, we want to make Glass capable of handling massive console applications without any syntax complexity. Not like a test program, but this time with proper Loops, Functions, Classes, Variables, Conditional statements and much more. This means that we need to Optimize, Enhance, and make Glass Powerful so that is much Easier to use.

## License
All code is licensed under an MIT license. This allows you to re-use the code freely, remixed in both commercial and non-commercial projects. The only requirement is to include the same license when distributing.
