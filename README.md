# Glass
Glass is primarily an early-stage Programming Language written in C++ almost from scratch. Glass is highly inspired by C# and Python, so programmer coming from these languages might not face any kind of problems. It is going to be a Powerful, Fast and Easy to Learn Programming Language. Currently not much is implemented, however the progress for Glass is on a pretty good track.

***Note: There is a much better version of Glass in-dev, basically the whole Language has been redone from scratch. So please wait for more info, Hope you understand ðŸ˜€***

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, Glass is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Glass`.

## The Plan
The plan for Glass is two-fold: to create a Powerful OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. It should be Powerful and Fast enough that it could handle running GUI applications and Game rendering, and it should be Easy enough that these application could be written in a very short amount of time. We may use OpenGL for Game rendering, but that's just what we expect to happen in future. It's totally possible for us to use DirectX, Vulkan or something else.

## Main Features to Come
- Classes
- Functions
- Graphics rendering
- Loops (For loops, While loops)
- GUI application development support
- Conditional statements (If else statements, Switch statements)
- Custom Library building support (By this feature you can make a Glass Library using ".glass" files only, this means you don't need to access the source code everytime you want to create a new Library for Glass)

And much more...

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.<br />
- Mingw-w64
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### How To Use
- To compile Glass, open Command Prompt in Glass Directory and type `scripts\Build.bat`.
- Then in "bin" folder, open Command Prompt and type `Glass "full path of your file"`.
- If you haven't created your own file then type `Glass "full path of any of the sample projects"` from `res\sample projects` folder.
- If you want to create your own Glass program then create a new file with an extention of `.glass` at the very end of it.

## Short Term Goals
By the end of 2021, we want to make Glass capable of handling massive console applications without any syntax complexity. Not like a test program, but this time with proper Loops, Functions, Classes, Variables, Conditional statements and much more. This means that we need to Optimize, Enhance, and make Glass Powerful so that is much Easier to use.

## License and Contributions
All code is licensed under an MIT license. This allows you to re-use the code freely, remixed in both commercial and non-commercial projects. The only requirement is to include the same license when distributing.

We welcome any contributions to Glass Programming Language development through pull requests on GitHub. Most of our active development is in the master branch, so we prefer to take pull requests there (particularly for new features).
